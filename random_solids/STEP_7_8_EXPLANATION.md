# Step 7, 7.5, and 8 Logic Explanation

## Overview
This document explains the topological approach implemented in steps 7, 7.5, and 8 of the solid reconstruction workflow.

## Step 7: Build Topological Edge-Face Data Structure

### Step 7.1: Vertex Array
- **Input**: `selected_vertices` - Nx3 array of 3D vertex coordinates
- **Purpose**: Foundation for all topology tracking
- **Example**: 22 vertices for seed 55

### Step 7.2: Edge Index Array with Face Columns
- **Purpose**: Track which faces each edge separates
- **Data Structure**:
  ```
  edge_array[edge_idx] = [vertex_1_idx, vertex_2_idx, face_1_idx, face_2_idx]
  ```
- **Initialization**: face_1 and face_2 set to -1 (empty)
- **Logic**:
  1. Extract all unique edges from connectivity matrix (merged_conn > 0)
  2. Store as sorted tuple (v1, v2) in edge_dict for fast lookup
  3. Create edge_list with columns: [v1, v2, -1, -1]

### Step 7.3: Face-Wire-Edge Data Structure
- **Purpose**: Represent faces as collections of wires (closed edge loops)
- **Data Structure**:
  ```python
  face_array = [
    {
      'face_idx': int,           # Face identifier
      'wires': [[edge_idx, ...]], # List of wires (first=outer, rest=holes)
      'polygon': [v_idx, ...],   # Vertex indices in cyclic order
      'normal': [nx, ny, nz]     # Face normal vector
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```
- **Logic**:
  1. For each extracted face polygon
  2. Build wire as list of edge indices connecting consecutive vertices
  3. First wire is outer boundary, subsequent wires are holes (if any)

### Step 7.4: Edge-Face Association Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Fill face_1 and face_2 columns to track adjacency
- **Logic**:
  ```
  For each face in face_array:
    For each wire in face['wires']:
      For each edge_idx in wire:
        If edge_array[edge_idx, 2] == -1:  # face_1 empty
          edge_array[edge_idx, 2] = face_idx
        Else if edge_array[edge_idx, 3] == -1:  # face_2 empty
          edge_array[edge_idx, 3] = face_idx
        Else:  # Both slots filled - EXCEPTION
          Report over-constrained edge
  ```
- **Exception Handling**: Detect edges shared by more than 2 faces (non-manifold)

### Step 7.5: Identify Dummy Polygons
- **Purpose**: Find faces not needed for closed topology
- **Boundary Edge**: Edge with only one associated face (face_1 != -1 and face_2 == -1, or vice versa)
- **Logic**:
  1. Find all boundary edges (one face == -1)
  2. Identify faces containing boundary edges
  3. Confirm dummy faces: ALL edges are boundary edges
- **Result**: Faces with all boundary edges are dummy (not part of closed solid)

### Step 7.6: Wire Visualization
- **Purpose**: Visual debugging of topology
- **Color Scheme**:
  - **Light Blue**: Outer wire (boundary of valid faces)
  - **Yellow**: Inner wire (holes within faces)
  - **Red**: Dummy polygon (not needed for topology)
- **Annotations**:
  - **Vertex Numbers**: V0, V1, ... (black text on white background)
  - **Face Numbers**: F0, F1, ... (blue/red text on yellow background)
    - Blue for valid faces
    - Dark red for dummy faces

## Step 8: Build Solid from Wire-Based Faces

### Step 8.1: Create OCC Faces from Wires
- **Purpose**: Convert topological wires to OpenCASCADE face objects
- **Logic**:
  1. Skip dummy faces (identified in Step 7.5)
  2. For each valid face:
     - Build OCC edges from consecutive vertices using `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeEdge`
     - Assemble edges into wire using `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeWire`
     - Create face from wire using `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeFace`
     - Validate face using `BRepCheck_Analyzer`
  3. Collect valid OCC faces in list

### Step 8.2: Stitch Faces into Solid
- **Purpose**: Combine faces into closed solid using topology-aware stitching
- **Algorithm**:
  1. **Sewing**: Use `BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing` to stitch faces
     - Add all valid OCC faces
     - Perform sewing operation (merges coincident edges)
  2. **Shell Extraction**: Extract shell from sewn shape using `TopExp_Explorer`
  3. **Shell Fixing**: Apply `ShapeFix_Shell` to fix orientation
  4. **Solid Construction**: Build solid from shell using `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeSolid`
  5. **Solid Fixing**: Apply `ShapeFix_Solid` for final corrections
  6. **Validation**:
     - Check validity with `BRepCheck_Analyzer`
     - Compute volume using `brepgprop_VolumeProperties`
     - Negative volume indicates face orientation issues

### Step 8.3: OCC Viewer Launch
- **Purpose**: Display reconstructed solid for visual inspection
- **Logic**:
  1. Check if solid was successfully created (occ_solid is not None)
  2. Check if viewer is enabled (not --no-occ-viewer)
  3. If both true:
     - Initialize OCC display using `init_display()`
     - Display solid shape
     - Start interactive viewer (blocks until window closed)
  4. Handle errors gracefully with traceback

## Key Improvements Over Previous Approach

1. **Explicit Topology**: Edge-face relationships explicitly tracked
2. **Dummy Face Detection**: Identifies faces not needed for closed solid
3. **Wire-Based Construction**: Supports faces with holes (proper topology)
4. **Visual Debugging**: Color-coded plot with vertex/face numbers
5. **Stitching Operation**: Topology-aware face merging vs. simple assembly

## Current Issues and Future Work

### Known Issues:
1. **Invalid Solid**: Volume is negative, indicating face orientation errors
2. **No Manifold Check**: Need to verify each edge has exactly 2 faces
3. **Hole Support**: Wire-based faces support holes, but none tested yet

### Future Improvements:
1. Add face orientation correction based on volume sign
2. Implement edge manifold validation (reject non-manifold edges)
3. Test with solids containing holes
4. Add interactive plot controls (toggle layers, zoom to face, etc.)
5. Export topology to standard formats (STEP, IGES)

## Usage

Run with seed 55 to see full topology workflow:

```bash
# With OCC viewer (interactive)
python Reconstruct_Solid.py --seed 55

# Without OCC viewer (diagnostics only)
python Reconstruct_Solid.py --seed 55 --no-occ-viewer
```
